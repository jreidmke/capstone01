## About IEP+

IEP+ is a small lightweight Flask Application to help special education teachers connect to the parents and guardians of the students they serve. 

## Usage

There are two sides to IEP+, the teacher facing side and the guardian facing side. Although they continually interact, they are securely separated through frontend and backend protection. 

## Teacher Facing  

If you are a first time user, register as a teacher by entering the correct school code. You will arrive at the your student list, containing a list of student objects as well as the teacher navbar.

### Teacher Navbar

The teacher navbar features routing to the **Add Student**, **Add Family**, **Messages**, and **Logout**. 

##### Add Student:
To add a student, simply fill out the form and submit the student to the database by hitting the **Add Student** button.

##### Add Family:
To add a family, fill out the form using the data displayed in the Guardian Information/Student Information dropdowns. Make sure you are committing the correct information before submitting.
